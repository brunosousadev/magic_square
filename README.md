# :information_source: Problem description
In recreational mathematics and combinatorial design, a magic square [1](http://jeff560.tripod.com/m.html) is a times n square grid (where n is the number of cells on each side) filled with distinct positive integers in the range (1,2,...,n^2) such that each cell contains a different integer and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal The sum is called the magic constant or magic sum of the magic square. A square grid with n cells on each side is said to have order n.
